# Calendar Automator

This python app has the following features:

- Create and Delete Calendars
- Create and Delete single events
- Create and Delete recurring events (with basic logic to create recurrence rules)
- Automated creation of multiple events based on configurable classes and deletion of all items in a calendar (careful with the last one!)
